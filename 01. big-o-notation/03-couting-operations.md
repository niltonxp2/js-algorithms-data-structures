## If not time, then what?

Rather than counting seconds, which are so variable...

Let's count the number of simple operations the computer has to perform!

3 simple operations, regardless of the size of n

Counting is hard!

Depending on what we count, the number of operations can be as low as 2n or as high as 5n + 2
But regardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly proportionally with n.

If n doubles, the number of operations will also roughly double
