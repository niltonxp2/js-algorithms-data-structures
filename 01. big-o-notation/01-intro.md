### Objectives

- Motivate the need for something like Big O Notation
- Describe what Big O Notation is
- Simplify Big O Expressions
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O Notation
- Describe what a logarithm is

### What's the idea here?

Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function.
How can we determine which one is the "best?"

### Who Cares?

- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
- Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
- When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
- Less important: it comes up in interviews!
