## BUILT-IN DATA STRUCTURES (Through the lens of Big O)

Now that we've covered BIG O...
Let's spend a couple minutes analyzing the things we do all the time in JS: working with Arrays, Objects, and built-in methods.
We spend a lot of this course talking about data structures.
Let's start by discussing the ones we get for free

## OBJECTIVES

- Understand how objects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
- Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
- Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods
