## Big O of Array Operations

- push - O(1)
- pop - O(1)
- shift - O(N)
- unshift - O(N)
- concat - O(N)
- slice - O(N)
- splice - O(N)
- sort - O(N \* log N)
- forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. - O(N)

## Limitations of Arrays

Inserting at the beginning is not as easy as we might think! There are more efficient data structures for that!
