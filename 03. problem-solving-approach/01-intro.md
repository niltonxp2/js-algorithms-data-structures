## Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

### OBJECTIVES

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

### WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

### Why do I need to know this?

Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!

It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer
