## UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

Note: many of these strategies are adapted from George Polya, whose book How To Solve
It is a great resource for anyone who wants to become a better problem solver

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
   5.How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.  
ok...
